### Introduction

API is an extension that allows you to build RESTful APIs and manage them within a TastyIgniter application.

However, it accomplishes more than just that, you may override the api actions (verbs) with your own logic. Default
behavior logic for several common verbs are supported â€” create, store, show, edit, update, destroy.
